# Unreleased version

- **BREAKING CHANGE** It's no longer required to call `useShinyalert()` in the UI. If you still want to explicitly pre-load the UI scripts, use `useShinyalert(force=TRUE)` (#47) 
- **BREAKING CHANGE** The `rmd` parameter of `useShinyalert()` is no longer used. If you still want to call `useShinyalert()` (which you don't need to) then you have to remove the `rmd` argument
- Fixed UI bug: tall modals did not have a scrollbar and you couldn't see the entire content (#44)
- Fixed UI bug: long strings in the modal got cut off (#53)
- Fixed UI bug: vertical scrollbar incorrectly appeared when dialog has no buttons (#49)
- Fixed UI bug: radio buttons and checkboxes did not render correctly (#55)
- New feature: added `session` parameter to allow advanced uses of shinyalert where the Shiny session isn't immediately accessible (thanks @galachad)
- New feature: `shinyalert` now supports MathJax to render equations, provided that `withMathJax()` is put in the UI (#54).

# shinyalert 2.0.0 (2020-09-11)

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Cannot use `html=TRUE` together with `type="input"`, you must instead supply your own Shiny inputs when using HTML
- **BREAKING CHANGE** When a modal closes automatically due to a timer, it returns `FALSE` (previously nothing was returned)
- New feature: added support for shiny inputs/outputs inside the modal (need to use `html=TRUE`) (#26)
- New feature: added `size` parameter to set the size (width) of the modal to one of four pre-defined sizes (#17)
- New feature: added `immediate` parameter to immediately show the current alert and close all previous alerts
- New feature: added `closeAlert()` function that allows you to close any specific alert (#29)
- `shinyalert()` now returns a unique ID
- Fixed bug where `callbackR` was not respected when the alert had a timer (#38)
- Fixed bug where an alert with a timer caused future alerts to not run (#39)
- Refactor of how unique IDs are created to ensure uniqueness in a performant way

# shinyalert 1.1 (2020-04-29)

- New feature (#11): `inputId` parameter added, which allows you to set the input ID that is used to retrieve the return value of the modal
- New feature (#12): support chaining modals, you can now call a shinyalert modal in the callback of another modal
- Fixed bug (#19) - alerts with an R callback were very slow when the environment had a large object
- New feature (#23): Support using `shinyalert` within Rmarkdown documents
- The return value can now be triggered even if the same input value is used consecutively (only if using shiny version 1.1)
- Documentation changes
- Improvements to demo shiny app UI
